# Ruby Directory
============================</br>

This is a newer directory for me, but I'm absolutely <b>loving</b> it so far. I've run into a few issues here and there. I'm willing to outline a few in this README file.

## Here is some information about the states.rb file.
- I ran into some issues with a few of the *classes* and *indexes*.</br>
- An example of a problem I ran into would have to be the random_question() method. I really struggled with calling the index and finding the correct random number.</br>
- Another issue I ran into would be the decision between using a hash, class/objects, or two seperate arrays. I initially used two arrays out of simplicity reasons. I then learned about classes and objects, and decided to switch it over to using those. It was a blessing in disguise.</br>

## Here is some information about the Hangman.rb file.
- I haven't ran into too many issues as of quite yet. </br>
- An issue I think I might run into is bringing in the words.txt file.</br>
- It's also quite a bit simpler than my states.rb file. So less issues.

## Some information about the WebTesting repository.
- I ran into a bug here and there with this project.</br>
- It is just not as well documented as more *up-to-date* frameworks.</br>
- But I still worked through it and got my tests to all pass and not throw any errors. </br>
- A big issue I ran into was following tutorials that didn't suit my laptop and/or version of Ruby that I was using. So, I simply decided to do what all developers do when in danger. Google it! But in all seriousness, I'm pretty proud of myself for getting this to work with little to no help from outside sources.
