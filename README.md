# Ruby Directory
=============================</br>

This is a newer directory for me, but I'm absolutely <b>loving</b> it so far. I've run into a few issues here and there. I'm willing to outline a few in this README file.

##Here is some information about the states.rb file.
- I ran into some issues with a few of the *classes* and *indexes*.</br>
- An example of a problem I ran into would have to be the random_question() method. I really struggled with calling the index and finding the correct random number.</br>
- Another issue I ran into would be the decision between using a hash, class/objects, or two seperate arrays. I initially used two arrays out of simplicity reasons. I then learned about classes and objects, and decided to switch it over to using those. It was a blessing in disguise.</br>
